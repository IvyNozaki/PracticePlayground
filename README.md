*I will have a navigation bar that links to the pages, as well as links in the introduction paragraphs below.*  

### About this project
This is just a fun side project where I implement the things I've learned so far in web development. Hoping to bring my ideas to life using CSS and Javascript.  
I want to create a main page that connects to three other pages that center around different applications.  

### Let's practice and play!
On this page I will practice coding a chatroom application.  

### Coffee, where art thou?
Here I want to practice coding by creating an online shop that sells original artwork and crafts.  

### Let's get cookin'
Here I want to practice code by creating an online recipe book. I want to be able to play around with different ways to check off ingridients and steps and build in timers in steps that require a set time.  

### Installation
If you would like to create your own Practice Playground, you can download a copy from my GitHub account. You can fully customize the space to practice coding. I have chosen these 3 applications for now but you can add more to your space.  

### Support
