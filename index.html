    <h2>Let's practice and play!</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Ivy Nozaki and I am learning to code. I will be implementing
      what I have learned to create my very own "practice playground" for
      coding. Open to discussions where we can talk about ideas.

    <h2>Coffee, where art thou?</h2>
    <p>
      Coffee = more awake time. Help support my coffee addiction by purchasing
      the ever growing stacks of stickers and prints. Original art by yours
      truly.

    <h2>Let's get cookin'</h2>
    <p>
      I live to eat and eat to live. Here are some of my go to recipes from
      someone broke and lazy. Warning: I am not a professional chef.
